                    <p>  The Sunny Acres Farmshop aims to offer the highest quality fresh produce. You can pick your own or buy it in our shop. Set amidst acres of outstanding natural beauty on the beautiful rolling hills northeast of Council Bluffs, the Farm Shop is easily reached on Highway G, with easy access from Interstate 80.

                    <p>The Farm Shop was established over 25 years ago with great success. Our products have won numerous awards at local festivals and fairs. We also cater to local supermarkets in the Council Bluffs/Omaha area. Look for our products every Saturday morning from May to October at the Council Bluffs Farmers' Market.

            <p>Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
            </p>
            <p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.
